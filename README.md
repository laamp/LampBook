# LampBook

NOTE: Not a live application yet

LampBook is a social app fashioned after the general functionality of Facebook. It is a project intended to familiarize myself with a tech stack that focuses on using Python for the back-end, specifically utilizing Flask.

## Tech Stack

NOTE: Subject to change

### Back-end

- Flask(Python)
- SQLite

### Front-end

- React.js(JavaScript)
- Redux

### Production

- Heroku
- GitHub

## How It Works

1. Users can create their own profile
1. Users can post content (Text posts first, other media later)
1. Users can add other users as friends asymmetrically to see their content in their feed

## Purpose

This is intended to be a fairly straightforward app that can easily have more functionality added to it as I become more familiar with other tech. It is also practice to create more complicated front-end designs. On the back-end this is teaching me another framework and also getting me familiar with Python.

## Resources

I am following along with the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg to get started on a Flask back-end.
